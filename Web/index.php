    	<div class="w">W</div>elcome to the <div class="projet">IoT_Stack</div> dynamic website, this webpage is a part of the SAE23 project initiated by the Blagnac college and made by four students :<br />
		- Roques Cl√©ment (Frontend developer)<br />
		- Roux Thomas (Backend developer)<br />
		- Naissant Mattieu (Frontend developer)<br />
		- Chauvet Matthias (Frontend developer)<br /><br />

		The purpose of this website is to manage the IOT system of the Blagnac college which includes : <br />
		- Severals building, floors and rooms<br />
		- Sensors of various types : temperature, co2 and luminosity<br /><br />

		Metrics are recovered from an MQTT broker by a PHP script embedded into a docker container and sent to a MariaDB database. <br />
		These metrics are generated every minute by a Bash script in a docker container before being sent to the MQTT broker.<br /><br />

		This website runs thanks to an Apache Web server also integrated into a docker container.<br /><br />

		An other part of this project consists in processing these metrics with nodeRED associated with InfluxDB + Grafana for visualization.<br />
		These services are accessible with the following URL :<br />
		- nodeRED : <a href="https://sae23.cloudroux.ovh/nodered/"> https://sae23.cloudroux.ovh/nodered/</a><br />
		- Grafana : <a href="https://sae23.cloudroux.ovh/grafana/"> https://sae23.cloudroux.ovh/grafana/</a><br /><br />

		PHPMyAdmin, the database management interface used by this website is also accesible with this URL : https://sae23.cloudroux.ovh/phpmyadmin/<br /><br />

		<div class="droite">

		</div>

		The complete workflow to recover and manage these metric is dockerized and can be run with only one command using docker-compose. <br /><br />

		Images are customized and uploaded into our Docker Hub repository : <a href="https://hub.docker.com/r/totorx/sae23"> https://hub.docker.com/r/totorx/sae23</a><br /><br />

		The whole stack is hosted on Thomas's server to be reachable from internet with the "sae23.cloudroux.ovh" domain name.<br /><br /> 

		For more information, take a look at our Github page : <a href="https://github.com/TheToto318/IoT_stack"> https://github.com/TheToto318/IoT_stack</a><br /><br />

		Thanks to the different tabs above you will be able to : <br />
		- Add/delete buildings to monitor with an associated manager account (only for administrator).<br />
		- Add/delete sensors with associated floor and room (only for administrator).<br />
		- See the last metrics recovered without authentication. (on the overview page).<br />
		- See metrics history for all rooms with graphs by logging with a manager credentials.<br /> <br />

		This website uses the following languages : <br />
		- HTML<br />
		- CSS<br />
		- PHP<br />
		- JavaScript<br />
