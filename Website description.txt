Welcome to the IoT_Stack dynamic website, this webpage is a part of the SAE23 project initiated by the Blagnac college and made by four students :
- Roques Cl√©ment (Frontend developer)
- Roux Thomas (Backend developer)
- Naissant Mattieu (Frontend developer)
- Chauvet Matthias (Frontend developer)

The purpose of this website is to manage the IOT system of the Blagnac college which include : 
- Severals building, floors and rooms
- Sensors of various types : temperature, co2 and luminosity 

Metric are recovered from an MQTT broker by a PHP script embedded into a docker container and sent to a MariaDB database. 
These metric are generated every minutes by a Bash script in a docker container before being send to the MQTT broker.

This website runs thanks to an Apache Web server also integrated into a docker container.

An other part of this project consist to process these metrics with nodeRED associated with InfluxDB + Grafana for visualization.
These services are accessible with the following URL :
- nodeRED : https://sae23.cloudroux.ovh/nodered/
- Grafana : https://sae23.cloudroux.ovh/grafana/

PHPMyAdmin interface to manage the database used by this website is also accesible with this URL : https://sae23.cloudroux.ovh/phpmyadmin/

The complete workflow to recover and manage these metric is dockerized and can be run with only one command using docker-compose. 

Images are customized and uploaded into our Docker Hub repository : https://hub.docker.com/r/totorx/sae23

The whole stack is hosted on Thomas's server to be reachable from internet with the "sae23.cloudroux.ovh" domain name.

Thanks to the different tab above you will be able to : 
- Add/delete buildings to monitor with an associated manager account (only for administrator).
- Add/delete sensors with associated floor and room (only for administrator).
- See the last metrics recovered without authentication. (on the overview page).
- See metrics history for all rooms with graphs by logging with a manager credentials.
